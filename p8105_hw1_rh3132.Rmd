#Problem 1#

```{r mean temp}
data ("early_january_weather")
 nrow(early_january_weather)
 ncol(early_january_weather)
mean (early_january_weather $ temp,)
```

##The dataset shows 358 entries and  15 total columns##
##the mean temperature is 39.58##

## plot##
```{r templot}
scatter_plot <- ggplot ( data=early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid)) + geom_point()
print(scatter_plot)

##The scatter plot displays a collection of points that vary with both highs and lows, but overall there is a positive trend. ##
